# Machine-Vision-Projects
University laboratory notebooks covering core topics in machine learning, probabilistic modelling, and AI fundamentals, implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebooks.


# Machine Learning & AI Labs

This repository contains a series of laboratory exercises completed as part of a university-level module in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.  
Each lab is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook and focuses on both theoretical understanding and practical implementation using Python.

The labs progressively build knowledge across core ML and AI concepts, combining mathematical foundations with hands-on experimentation.
